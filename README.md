Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Data Loading: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.
Handling Missing Data: Missing values were handled using forward-fill imputation to ensure continuity.
Feature Engineering:
Created new features such as the hour of the day and day of the week based on the timestamp.
Introduced binary features to capture weather conditions (e.g., whether it’s raining).
Normalization and Scaling: Continuous features such as distance and temperature were scaled to standardize the input data for machine learning models.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables (e.g., pickup locations and event types) were transformed into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Demand and Supply Analysis: Visualized demand trends based on external conditions such as weather and time of day.
Price Sensitivity: Analyzed how price changes affected demand, revealing insights into customer price sensitivity.
Step 3: Model Development
Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and test sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Model Selection: A Random Forest Regressor was chosen due to its ability to capture complex relationships between input features and the target price.
Demand Forecasting: A time series model (ARIMA) was used to predict demand trends based on historical data.
Dynamic Pricing Algorithm: A dynamic pricing function was developed to suggest optimal pricing based on factors such as demand, weather, and available drivers.
Step 4: Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: The model was evaluated using:
Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the accuracy of price predictions.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² to evaluate prediction consistency and model fit.
Evaluation Results: The model performed well with an acceptable MSE and R² score, indicating that it can predict prices with reasonable accuracy.
Step 5: Insights & Visualization
Scenario Analysis: Visualized how different pricing strategies would affect revenue and customer retention.
Real-Time Dashboard: A dashboard was created using Dash to visualize real-time demand, prices, and external conditions (weather, events).
Step 6: Final Deliverables
Source Code: The Python code that preprocesses data, builds and trains the model, and generates predictions.
Documentation: A detailed report on the methodology, model evaluation, and insights.
Presentation: A slide deck summarizing the project’s goals, approach, findings, and business impact.
Model File: The trained model ready for deployment.
README: Instructions on setting up and running the code.
Steps for the Project
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Load the Dataset: Load the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handle Missing Data: Check for missing values and handle them using imputation or removal.
Feature Engineering:
Extract features such as the hour of the day, day of the week, and weather conditions.
Create binary features (e.g., rain = 1, no rain = 0).
Normalize Data: Scale continuous features like distance and temperature using StandardScaler.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features (e.g., pickup location, event type) to numerical form using one-hot encoding.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Demand and Supply Analysis: Use visualizations to analyze how demand changes with time of day, weather conditions, and events.
Price Sensitivity Analysis: Investigate the relationship between price and demand.
Step 3: Model Development
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Model Selection: Train different machine learning models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict ride prices.
Demand Forecasting: Incorporate a time-series model (e.g., ARIMA) to predict demand fluctuations based on historical data.
